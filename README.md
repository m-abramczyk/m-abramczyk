## Hi, I'm Maciej,
an architect turned fullstack developer. I'm into designing with systems, clean UI and backend logic.

- I build fast, responsive websites using Django and custom JS/HTML/CSS frontends.
- Active across the stack, with a growing interest in DevOps and infrastructure.
- Learning React, Next.js, Django REST, and Tailwind, to integrate a fullstack workflow with modern tooling.

Currently building: my own portfolio site (Next.js + Django REST)
Previously: international architecture projects, competition wins, and running my own architecture + 3d rendering practice.
