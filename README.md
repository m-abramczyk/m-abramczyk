## Hi, I'm Maciej
Architect turned fullstack developer. I like building things as systems â€” from clean UI to backend (and occasionally, actual buildings).

- I build fast, responsive websites using Django and custom JS/HTML/CSS frontends.
- I'm active across the stack, with a growing interest in DevOps and infrastructure.
- Right now learning React, Next.js, Django REST, and Tailwind, to integrate a fullstack workflow with modern tooling.

Currently building: my own portfolio site (Next.js + Django REST)<br>
Previously: international architecture competition wins, and running my own architecture + 3d rendering practice.
